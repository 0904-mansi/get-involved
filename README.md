# Docker Community Site

This repo contains the [hugo](https://gohugo.io) templates and themes for the
Docker Community website. Basically, this should contain the formatting for the website,
and [`dockercommunity/docs`](https://github.com/docker-community-leaders/dockercommunity/docs) should contain the content
for the website.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) if you want to make changes.
