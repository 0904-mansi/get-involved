     Docker's own events management platform (powered by Bevy) https://events.docker.com
---

We've chosen Bevy to provide innovative features for event organizers, including:

- 2 way integration with Meetup.com (create your event in Bevy and it posts to your meetup page and RSVPs from your event on meetup sync with your Bevy events.docker.com page).

Note: The RSVP limits you set in Bevy do not translate to meetup. The best way to handle this is to keep a watchful eye on both platforms or communicate that seats are first come first serve. 

- Ability to check in guests.
- Mobile App
- RSVP as Guest
- Forms / Surveys
- Automatic Emails (customizable)
