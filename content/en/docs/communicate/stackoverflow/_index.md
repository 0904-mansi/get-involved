Docker is a tool to build and run containers. Questions concerning Dockerfiles, operations, and architecture are accepted. 
Questions about running docker in production may find better responses on ServerFault (https://serverfault.com/). 
The docker tag is rarely used alone and is often paired with other tags such as docker-compose and kubernetes.
