#### [Getting Started (Private)](https://github.com/docker/captains/blob/master/getting-started.md)
*This repo includes more information on which platforms we use (and why!), where to ask questions and more.*


#### [Docker Captains Briefings (Private)](https://github.com/docker/captains/blob/master/briefings.md)
*This repo contains links to all of the recorded briefings including videos, slides and relevant blog posts.*


#### [Swim Lanes for Docker Captains (Private)](https://github.com/docker/captains/blob/master/swimlanes.md)
*The Swim Lanes are a guide to topics that are of interest to the Docker community. Check out this link to see how we are mangaing Captains content creation and speaking events.*


#### [CFP Schedule for Docker Captains (Private)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17eOb9IpV5S3brlXZPlQz5J50RPk6-67e0NUdOLMJXC0/edit?usp=sharing)
*We update this sheet regularly with CFP opportunities for Docker Captains. If you see an event that is missing, [please ping us](mailto:events@docker.com) and we can add it!*


#### [Docker Captains Code of Conduct (Private)](https://github.com/docker/captains/blob/master/program-guidelines.md)
*By becoming a member of this program, you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct. This is to ensure that the Captains are a respected, professional group that has a positive impact in the ecosystem. The Code of Conduct is not a comprehensive list of do’s and don’ts, but rather a living set of guidelines to follow that we will continue to refine as the program matures. You are responsible for keeping abreast of changes to this document.*

#### [Mobilize (Private)](https://community.docker.com)
*Mobilize is a way for Captains to connect and collaborate with each other. The Mobilize platform helps you stay updated on events, activities, and programs happening in the Docker Captains program. It is a useful tool for you to share ideas, best practices (and files) and communicate with the fellow Docker Captains.
